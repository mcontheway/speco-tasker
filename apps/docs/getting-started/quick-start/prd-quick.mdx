# Writing a PRD

A PRD (Product Requirements Document) helps you plan and organize your tasks in Speco Tasker. It defines what you're building and why. A clear PRD improves the quality of your task planning and final product — so it's worth taking the time to get it right.

<Tip>
You don’t need to define your whole app up front. You can write a focused PRD just for the next feature or module you’re working on.
</Tip>

<Tip>
You can start with an empty project or you can start with a feature PRD on an existing project.
</Tip>

<Tip>
You can add and parse multiple PRDs per project using the --append flag
</Tip>

## What Makes a Good PRD?

- Clear objective — what’s the outcome or feature?
- Context — what’s already in place or assumed?
- Constraints — what limits or requirements need to be respected?
- Reasoning — why are you building it this way?

The more context you provide, the better your task planning and results.

## Writing a PRD for Speco Tasker

<Note>An example PRD can be found in .taskmaster/templates/example_prd.txt</Note>

You can write your PRD manually using any text editor:

1. **Define requirements** — clearly explain what you want to build.
2. **Use the example PRD** — reference the example PRD to understand the expected format. Following the example will help you create better structured PRDs.
3. **Iterate and refine** — review and improve your PRD draft to ensure clarity.

---

## Where to Save Your PRD

Place your PRD file in the `.taskmaster/docs` folder in your project.

- You can have **multiple PRDs** per project.
- Name your PRDs clearly so they’re easy to reference later.
  - Examples: `dashboard_redesign.txt`, `user_onboarding.txt`

# Using Your PRD in Speco Tasker

Once you have written your PRD, you can use it to manually create tasks in Speco Tasker.

You can create tasks manually using the CLI or MCP interface:

```bash
# Create tasks manually based on your PRD
task-master add-task --prompt "Implement user authentication system"
task-master add-task --prompt "Create database schema for users"
task-master add-dependency --id=2 --depends-on=1
```

Or through MCP in your editor:

```
Add a new task: Implement user authentication system
```

This will help you organize your work based on the requirements defined in your PRD. You can create tasks, set dependencies, and track progress manually.

Now that you have written a PRD, you are ready to start setting up your tasks.
