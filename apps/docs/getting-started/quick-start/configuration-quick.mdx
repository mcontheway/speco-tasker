Speco Tasker requires no API keys or external configuration. It's a pure manual task management system that works completely offline.

## Configuration

Speco Tasker has minimal configuration requirements. The system works out of the box with sensible defaults.

### Basic Settings

The main configuration file (`.taskmaster/config.json`) allows you to customize basic behavior:

- `logLevel`: Logging verbosity (default: "info")
- `projectName`: Optional name for your project
- `defaultTag`: Default tag for task grouping (default: "main")
- `defaultPriority`: Priority level for new tasks (default: "medium")

### Tag Management

Speco Tasker supports organizing tasks by tags:

- Create separate task contexts for different features or branches
- Switch between tag contexts as needed
- Tasks in different tags are completely isolated

### Project Structure

Speco Tasker creates the following structure in your project:

```
.taskmaster/
├── tasks/
│   ├── tasks.json      # Main task database
│   └── *.md           # Individual task files
├── docs/
│   └── prd.txt        # Product requirements (optional)
└── config.json        # Configuration file
```

<Note>
Most users don't need to modify the configuration. Speco Tasker works perfectly with default settings for manual task management workflows.
